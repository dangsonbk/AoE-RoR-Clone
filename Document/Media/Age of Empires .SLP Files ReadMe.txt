INTRODUCTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This list contains descriptions of all the .SLP graphic files contained within GRAPHICS.DRS. 

The .SLP files were extracted from GRAPHICS.DRS using Stoyan Ratchev's excellent DRSBUILD utility. Suffice to say that without it, this list probably would not have been compiled in the first place. A lot of credit must go to Stoyan. 

As much as possible, this list has been demarcated using page or line breaks. This was to structure it in such a way as to show certain patterns in the files of the list. 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Just a small explanation on the notation and terminology used in the list...

A)	Files preceded by '(?)' are those I am unsure of

B)	Files marked '(?) livery' are those used on different buildings as 'windows' for the tribe colors to show through. 
	
	These are ones I have not got around to providing with detailed descriptions as to which ones belong to which buildings. I will probably complete them later on in a new version of the list.

C)	Files marked 'shadow' are those which, I believe, are used as shadows for different buildings andd units
	
	These are also ones I have not got around to providing with detailed descriptions. I will probably complete them later on in a new version of the list.

d)	Files marked with a '#?' are mostly terrain or 'plant' files, which can be seen using the Scenario Editor.

	I have not matched up the files with their numbers (as used in the Scenario Editor)

e)	The 'Level X of Y - T' notation used on building files show that a specific file is the Xth version of Y number of incarnations for tribe T (if any), for that particular building.

	For example, a House has four incarnations - one for each Age. All the tribes share a common Stone Age house, so the file for that house is noted as (Level 1 of 4). Similarly, the Greek Bronze Age House will be notes as (Level 3 of 4 - Greek).

	Please note that in the notation (as in the AOE Help File),
	Asian applies to  Choson, Shang and Yamato
	Babylonian applies to  Babylonian, Hittite and Persian
	Egyptian applies to	Assyrian, Egyptian and Sumerian
	Greek applies to	Greek, Minoan and Phoenician


f)	The Military Units in the list can be sectioned off into the following five groups :-
	(1)	facing S
	(2)	nodding ?
	(3)	dead!
	(4)	standing guard
	(5)	moving S

	'nodding' may not be a very good description, hence the '?'. Take a look at them yourself especially the infantry units an you'll see why I chose it. 
	
	I think that 'facing S' and 'standing guard' may be the same, except for the fact that some units are missing in one set.


As can be seen, many of the descriptions are not complete. As such, I would appreciate any help that anybody can offer to help me make it more 'polished'.
